# Problem Statement

Traditional student engagement methods in universities often suffer from several limitations:

## 1. Lack of Transparency
Student elections, raffles, and other participatory events often occur behind closed systems, creating doubts about fairness and outcomes.

## 2. Limited Incentives
Thereâ€™s usually little or no reward for students to participate in campus activities beyond personal satisfaction, which reduces consistent involvement.

## 3. Centralized Control
University authorities or student bodies typically manage and control events, leaving room for manipulation, favoritism, and lack of inclusiveness.

## 4. Minimal Web3 Exposure
Most students have little interaction with blockchain or decentralized tools, missing out on valuable tech experience and opportunities.

## 5. Engagement Fatigue
Traditional formats are repetitive and lack innovation, failing to maintain long-term interest among students.
