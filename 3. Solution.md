# Solution

ScholFi addresses key issues in student engagement using blockchain technology. Here's how our platform solves the core problems:

## 1. Transparency and Fairness
- All interactions (polls, bets, raffles, and staking) are powered by smart contracts, ensuring on-chain transparency.
- Chainlink VRF provides verifiable randomness, eliminating manipulation in raffles and other chance-based activities.

## 2. Incentivized Participation
- Students earn rewards through staking and successful participation in events.
- This gamified approach motivates consistent interaction within the platform.

## 3. Low-Cost Transactions
- Built on Arbitrum, a fast and low-fee Layer 2 network, ScholFi enables gasless or low-cost participation, making it accessible to all students.

## 4. Web3 Education & Adoption
- ScholFi provides a hands-on experience for students to interact with wallets, smart contracts, and decentralized technologies.
- It encourages blockchain literacy while offering real-world value.

## 5. Decentralization & Security
- By removing central control, ScholFi ensures all data and outcomes are publicly verifiable and secure.
- IPFS and blockchain protect data and assets against tampering.
